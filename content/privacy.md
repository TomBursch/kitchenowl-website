# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: Dec 16, 2024_

This privacy policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the service and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

The KitchenOwl applications, including the Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux applications, and websites, including the homepage  and documentation, do not send any data to any service without your authorization.

We love open-source software; thus we will never monetize or sell your information, and this service and software will always stay free and open.

## Security of Your Personal Data

The security of your personal data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Stored data
##### What data does the landing page (this website) use?
We use the open source Plausible Analytics routed and self-hosted through our `stats` subdomain to count website visits, downloads, etc. No cookies are used, and no personal data is stored.

##### What data does the application use?

- Local preferences
- Online cloud service credentials:
  - Cloud service URI
  - Tokens for authentication

The application does not use any tracking APIs.

##### What data does the cloud service use?

The cloud is used to store and sync every piece of content that you create inside the application. Data is encrypted in transit.

If you do not use the [default cloud service](https://app.kitchenowl.org), you should consult the third-party cloud service's privacy policy.

##### What data can the server owner see?

- All information provided during the sign-up process, including but not limited to your username and email address.
- Information about any device that connects to the server, including but not limited to the device's operating system, browser, and IP address.
  - This information is stored for up to 30 days after the device was last used.
- All content you upload and store inside the application, including images.

##### How can I delete my data?

1. If you use the default cloud service, you can head to the account deletion page by going to Settings, User, "more", then "Delete account". Once you confirm the action, your account and any data associated with it will be irreversibly deleted.
   - Households may not be deleted if other members are present.
2. If you use a third-party cloud service, the steps should be similar to the default cloud service. If not, contact the server administrator or consult the server's privacy policy.

##### Data retention
- We retain your account data and content for as long as your account is active.
- Backups may be retained for 90 days before being permanently deleted.
- Device information is stored for up to 30 days after the device was last used.

Again, this is only applicable if you use the [default cloud service](https://app.kitchenowl.org); if not, you should consult the third-party cloud service's privacy policy.

## Legal Basis for Processing Data

We process your data in accordance with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The legal basis for processing your data depends on the specific context in which it is collected and used:

1. **Consent** By signing up for and using our service, you provide your consent for us to process your personal data as outlined in this Privacy Policy. This includes processing necessary to enable core functionality, such as storing and syncing your data in the cloud. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by deleting your account or contacting us. However, withdrawing consent may prevent you from accessing certain features or services.
2. **Contractual Necessity** We process your data when it is necessary to fulfill a contract with you or provide the services you request. This includes:
    - Managing your account and authenticating access.
    - Storing and syncing your content in the cloud.
3. **Legitimate Interests** We process your data to serve the core functionality of the app and ensure it operates effectively. For example:
    - Enabling data synchronization across devices.
    - Ensuring the performance and reliability of our service.
4. **Compliance with Legal Obligations** In certain cases, we process your data to comply with applicable laws or respond to lawful requests from public authorities.

## Third-Party Data Sharing

We do not share any data you provide with third parties. All data processed by our applications remains local to your device or stored securely on the cloud service you choose to use. If you opt to use a third-party cloud service, please refer to their privacy policy to understand how they handle your data.

## Links to Other Websites

Our service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site.
We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy of every site you visit.
We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Children's Privacy

Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.
If you are a parent or guardian, and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.
If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parent's consent before we collect and use that information.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update our privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.
We will let you know via email and/or a prominent notice on our service prior to the change becoming effective and update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date at the top of this privacy policy.
You are advised to review this privacy policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this privacy policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
